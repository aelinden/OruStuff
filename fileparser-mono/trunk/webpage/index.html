<p>
	<a name="ABOUT"><h2>About</h2></a>
		This program parses a file consisting of survey info. It summarizes the number of times <br>
		each student in a class has been nominated while excluding self-nominations and cross class nominations.<br>
		The program also calculates percentages, averages, standard deviations and individual differences.<br>
</p>

	<a name="PRE"><h2>Program prerequisites</h2></a>
		The file parser is written in C# using Gtk# which means some packages have to be installed on your computer
		before it can be run.
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=333325fd-ae52-4e35-b531-508d977d32a6">Microsoft .NET</a>
						(.NET is most likely already installed on your computer)
				<li> <a href="http://ftp.novell.com/pub/mono/gtk-sharp/gtk-sharp-2.12.9-2.win32.msi">Gtk Sharp</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		Without these packages installed, the program will not run.

	Usage section. Explains input file syntax and program usage.

<p>
	<a name="USAGE"><h2>Program usage</h2></a>
		Before starting the program, its input file must have the correct syntax and be in an acceptable format.

		<h3>The Excel file</h3>		
			The excel file being used to create the input file for the program should look like this:
			<p>
				<img src="filesyntax.jpg">
			</p>
			The First column is the student id, the second the class of the student and third column and forward
			is the students answer to the question mentioned in the top row in the same column. (Ex. In the picture above,
			student with id <i>1</i> in class <i>171</i> nominated student with id <i>10</i> in class <i>171</i> for question <i>SK1A</i>)
			The first row is the header row which must contain the question names (SK1A, SK1B and so on). 
					
		<h3>The input file</h3>
			For the program to be able to process this file, it must be converted from Excel-format to text format. 
			<ul>
				<li>If you are using Excel, choose File -> Save As and as file type select <i>Text (Tab delimited)</i>.</li><br>
				<li>If you are using OpenOffice, choose File -> Save As and select <i>Text CSV</i> as file type. Make sure that no text delimiter is set. 
					That is, the value for text delimiter should be blank. If it is not, the program will not parse the
					resulting file correctly. The Field delimiter should be set to <i>{tab}</i>.</li>
			</ul>
			When saved a text version of the Excel file will be created that can be parsed by the program.

		<h3>Running the program</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Unpack the program anywhere on your computer. No installation is required.</li>
			<li>Start the program by double clicking its icon</li>
			<li>Select the text file you created earlier by clicking the <i>Open</i>-button.
			When the file has been selected, the status bar will display the file name.</li>
			<li>Click the <i>Calculate</i> button to process the file.</li>
			<li>Click the <i>View/Save</i>-button to display the results.</li>
			<li>A view window will now show the results, and to save the results to a file, click the <i>Save</i>-button.
			A popup will inform you that the file has now been saved. The saved file will be placed in the same directory
			as the input file.</li>

			You can now open the results file in Excel or OpenOffice. If you are using OpenOffice, when importing set the field delimiter
			to <i>{tab}</i> (Since this was what was set as delimiter when exporting the file, and is what the program uses as delimiter)
			and the data should be imported correctly.
		</ul>
